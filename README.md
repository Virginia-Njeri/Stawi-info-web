# stawi-brood

**Overview:**

In an effort to reduce chick mortality by providing small-scale poultry farmers in Kenya with a conducive brooding environment for chick-rearing to meet the demand for chicken production, we decided to come up with an IoT-based solution to automate the conditions within the brooder. This is a project that ensures the conditions within the brooder i.e temperature, humidity, feeding, and drinking are automated at optimal levels for chicks to sustain their growth to slaughter stage.
